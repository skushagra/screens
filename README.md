# screens | Realtime Wallpaper Syncing

### Inspiration
I design the wallpapers for devices myself and syncing them across devices is a real pain. Mainly I use Kali Linux, but I also have a instance of Windows which I ocasionally use, for work I use a Mac.
### Aim
This repository has code for a service which will automatically fetch my wallpapers from a object storage and maintain and change them across all my devices based on server time.
### Expectations
The expectation is to have a UI through which the user can connect a object storage and then see and upload wallpapers on it. The using a service for their operating system, they can register devices and enable or disable wallpaper syncing on them.
